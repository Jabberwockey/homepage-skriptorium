Rogar Trunkenbart can only stand other humans if he's distracted by
alcohol or games. As he wants to afford a tour of the worst taverns
in the Dragonlands, he's writing a book about games.

Follow the ill-mannered author to the world of fun things to do with friends.
Regardless whether we are talking about games with dice, cards, boards or other
things one could deem "games".
