Albrecht Knutson, played by Pascal Lipinski, is the right hand of the director,
Bartholom√§us Federkiel. Due to his direct but honest and true personality, the director
entrusts him with the major part of PR and sales operations at the Scriptorium.

It is thanks to Albrecht's tireless efforts that the Scriptorium is now one of the
contact points for the Parenus Foundation.
