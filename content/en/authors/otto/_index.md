Otto, played by Alex Betzing, is... well, he's an Otto. But we have grown quite attached
to his presence in our team. If he's not helping customers getting books, he's busy illustrating
and he has a lot of fans who appreciate his work.

He proved his good eye for cartography and drawing skills as a juror at the treasure map competition.
